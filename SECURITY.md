## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any security vulnerabilities in this project, please do not be surprised - most likely I put them there on purpose.
However, please feel free to report it via the [new private security reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) on GitHub so I have some nice demo content to play with! :-)
